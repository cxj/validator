# Change Log

## 0.0.4

Bug fix to `bind()`, see commit 5011902.

## 0.0.3

Not all unit tests were being run.  Fixing that bug uncovered more bugs
in code under test.  Those were subsequently fixed.  Previous versions
are seriously broken; do not use them.

## 0.0.2

This revises the API to provide only one version of bind() which is now smart enough to handle a variable number of parameters.

## 0.0.1

First release.

Fully functional but missing documentation on how to use it.
