# Validator

This library contains efficient functional programming (FP) routines
to test the input and output parameters of your methods. With these
validations, you can greatly reduce the amount of coding needed to
write a safe implementation.

## About

This library is inspired by Larry Garfield's [book] _Thinking
Functionally in PHP_ and builds upon Benjamin Eberlei's [assert
package], and the [revised version] by Bernhard Schussek
